    INSTRUCTIONS
---------------------

    1.  Use it to register all the cash transactions produced in your daily economy.
        Transactions for covering expenses (renting, food, car, party expenses) and
        receiving incomes (salary, bet earnings or clothes sales). Both lists could be increased,
        even let the user create its own expense and income types.

    2.  Do not care about currencies. Feel free to register an expense in bitcoin and let the system
        make the calculus with all transactions in euros. Other currencies could be include via API Rest
        to have all possible conversion rates.
        
    3.  Finally, lookup your expenses and incomes independently, but also review all transactions in the
        exact order of entrance to the system. Do not forget to view your available current cash.
